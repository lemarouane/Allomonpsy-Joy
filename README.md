# Joy Chatbot
This repository contains the source code for JOY chatbot built using React for the frontend and Python with AWS Lambda for the backend:



## Overview
The JOY chatbot allows users to have a conversation with the AI, either by sending text messages or audio files. The frontend is built using React and Material-UI, while the backend leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT models and ElevenLabs' Text-to-Speech API.

## Quick Start
Before you start using the JOY chatbot, make sure to follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project root.
2. Install the necessary dependencies for the frontend by running npm install in the terminal.


### the steps 4 and 5 are problems for me so far 


4. Deploy the Lambda function using the Serverless Framework:
5. Once the Lambda function is deployed, update the API Gateway URL in your frontend code in `App.js`


6. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start`.
